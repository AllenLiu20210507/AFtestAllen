# AFtestAllen
Hi Appsflyer team,
Sorry I can't test the non-organic and the inapp event successfully.
When I was integrating the AF Android SDK,I always got 403 forbidden issue from the SDK log and the charles.So I checked the releated docs and found that
this issue might be because the test account is the Zero package enable account, which does not include attribution data; only data on clicks and impressions.   
Please check the log and charles data attached in logandchls folder.
